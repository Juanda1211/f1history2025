        <h2 >Formula One, or F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater 
            formula racing cars. It's a global motorsport competition governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
             A season consists of a series of races called Grands Prix, held around the world, often on purpose-built circuits. 
             These races are a high-stakes competition where teams design and build their own cars, and drivers pilot them at incredible speeds,
              pushing the limits of technology and human skills. </h2></div>

              <strong>BRIEF F1 HISTORY</strong><br>
              Formula One (F1) officially began in 1950, but its roots trace back to the European Grand Prix championships of the 1920s and 1930s. 
              The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) standardized the rules in 1946, leading to the first World Championship of Drivers in 1950.
              The inaugural race was held at Silverstone, with Giuseppe Farina winning the championship.

              <strong>F1 ENGINES BRIEF</strong><br>
              Formula 1 engine regulations have significantly evolved throughout the history of the sport,
              transitioning from large naturally aspirated engines to turbocharged and then hybrid power units.
              Initially, engine size and configuration were relatively open, leading to diverse approaches from different 
              teams. Over time, regulations were introduced to control engine size, aspiration (naturally aspirated vs. 
              turbocharged), and eventually, the introduction of hybrid systems.
